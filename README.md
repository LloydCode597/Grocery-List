# Grocery-List

This basiclly it's just a glorified to do list where we can add the items.
We can also edit the items, we can delete them and clear all of them from the list.
We also usig local storage. So that way, once we refresh the application, we still get all the info that we have right now. Therefore, each time the actual user will come back to the application; it will be served in a local storage.
